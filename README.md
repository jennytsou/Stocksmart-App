## Demo of our Project <a name="Demo"></a>

## How to Run the Project <a name="Running"></a>
After downloading source code from the github page, which will download as "Investment-App-main", open the folder within a running Python environment. To start the StockSmart Flask website, run the following three commands: (1) `export FLASK_APP=stockApp`, (2) `export FLASK_ENV=development`, and (3) `flask run`. Then click the resulting website link, or manually enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, to see the website in action.

## Unit Testing the Flask Application <a name="Testing"></a>
We used the python built-in framework `unittest`, to write the unit tests for our Python flask application. Our unit test are contained in the file `test.py`. We tested to make sure that flask was set up correctly, that each html page loads correctly, and that each page’s functions work correctly.
